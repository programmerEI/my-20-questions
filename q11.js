//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names = ["ayesha,iqra,anila"];
var message = "would you like to learn typescript";
console.log(names[0] + message);
console.log(names[1]);
console.log(names[2]);
